> _Algorithm Analysis and Design is a compulsory subject that consists of 3 credits. It will introduce the student to the management of algorithms that allow solving the different non-trivial problems that are available to computers. The analysis of the efficiency and quality of these algorithms, as well as their main design techniques, will be the essential objectives of the course. The student will be provided with the basic algorithmic techniques that will allow him to approach the development of correct and efficient programs._

>The ordering algorithms allow us, as the name implies, to order information in a special way based on a sorting criterion.
>
>In computing data ordering plays a very important role, either as an end in itself or as part of other more complex procedures. Many techniques have been developed in this area, each with specific characteristics, and with advantages and disadvantages over the others.
>
>To give you an idea of â€‹â€‹the difficulty of the problem, I propose the following mini game. These are a few barrels to sort (between 3 and 10) in order to gain weight. The weight of each barrel was randomized. Use the "drag and drop" option to move the barrels.
>
>You have an uncalibrated scale that allows you to compare the weight of barrels and shelves that can be used for intermediate storage. These are exactly the same items as those available to a computer: a comparison function and storage areas. The goal is obviously to order the barrels with the fewest comparisons and exchanges possible.
