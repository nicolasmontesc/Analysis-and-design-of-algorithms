Shiny like a limousine
you are spending like a cash machine
smile show your golden teeth
that is how you cover up your cavities

You are glowing like a diamond ring
i saw you bought some other things
you are spending like a cash machine
to cover up your insecurities
do not front no need

When is it enough
how bad do you need that stuff
what is it all for
why is it seem like you still want more

When is it enough
turns out you do not need that stuff
what is it all for
why is it seem like you still want more
